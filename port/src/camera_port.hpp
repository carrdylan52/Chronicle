// The mouse turns the game's cameras where the right stick does, by the angle it moved
// (InputGetMouseLook) rather than through a stick's dead zone, steps and full deflection. A camera
// reads it in its stick's units, added to the stick's reading, so its own conditions (R1 and L1
// only while the stick rests) see both alike; the town's walk camera takes it apart (below).
//
// A follow camera eases towards its angle and its eye towards its place (CCameraFollow::Step,
// CCamera::Step), which suits a stick's small steady steps but trails the mouse and takes the
// shorter way round, backwards, once a step passes half a turn. So a turning reading also leaves
// the mouse's share with the camera, and the camera's next AddAngle within the same pad read, if
// it is exactly that reading's delta, turns the camera by the share at once
// (port/src/camerafollow.cpp); the stick's share and everything else the camera does still ease.
// Height is not taken at once: the floor and ceiling limits the game puts on it afterwards bound
// only where the eye is going.

// AddAngle(radians * -reading): right turns right.

// circles by the mouse's angle, mouse up looking up. The mouse raises the eye no higher than
// ceiling, and never requests a height below floor. The eye continues looking at the follow
// target; height changes keep the retail easing and collision correction.
