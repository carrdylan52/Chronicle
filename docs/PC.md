# PC port

`PLATFORM=PC` builds the game's code as a native x64 Linux program with clang
20, as C++26, on SDL3 and Vulkan 1.4 (`docs/MACOS.md` covers macOS on Apple
Silicon, `docs/WINDOWS.md` x64 Windows). The port accepts PAL and NTSC game data;
there is no region setting. The game runs 60 ticks a
second, and the code that sped PAL up for its 50 Hz (`#ifdef PAL_TIMING` in
ps2/src, which only the PS2 PAL build defines) is left out. `docs/PC_PORT_PLAN.md` is the plan it was built
to and records the phases; this document describes what is built.

## Building and running

```sh
./build.sh linux-x64
(cd port/build/pc && ctest --output-on-failure -j4)
```

The build runs in the dev container (in place when already inside one) using
the Debug `linux-x64` preset, and discards a `CMakeCache.txt` configured for
another source path. `CLEAN=1`
discards `port/build/pc` first; `JOBS=N` sets the number of parallel build jobs.

The tests are GoogleTest cases, each a unit test that finishes in
milliseconds; none of them runs the whole game. The `AudioRealData` cases read
the title pack out of the extracted data and are skipped unless `DC_DATA` names
it.

`cmake --preset linux-x64` (and `linux-x64-release`, in `port/build/pc-release`)
with `cmake --build --preset` and `ctest --preset` of the same name does the
same.

It needs clang 20 with lld, Python 3, CMake 3.28, Ninja,
`glslangValidator`, SDL3 (3.4) and the Vulkan 1.4 headers and loader, and at
run time a device with Vulkan 1.3 or later, `dualSrcBlend` and `shaderClipDistance`
(any desktop driver; Mesa's lavapipe in CI; `port/src/gfx/README.md`, "Device", has the whole list). `.github/workflows/pc.yml` is a
complete recipe on Ubuntu 26.04.

The game's files come from the disc (see "Game data"). Without them a
windowed start asks for the disc image and extracts it; `dcdata` does the
same from a shell:

```sh
port/build/pc/dcdata extract "rom/Dark Cloud (PAL).iso" data
port/build/pc/darkcloud --data data --save save
```

The extractor accepts a PAL or NTSC disc image. For NTSC data it supplies the
localized filenames and pack members expected by the shared game code. Original
disc files remain in the extracted tree for verification against `DATA.HD2`;
normalized pack copies live under `data/normalized` and are selected by the
port's file index. Extract again after updating the port to refresh them.

`darkcloud` takes:

| Option | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--data DIR` | the extracted data (default: `DC_DATA`, then `./data`, then `data/` beside the executable, then `$XDG_DATA_HOME/chronicle/data`) |
| `--save DIR` | saves, `config.json`, the pipeline cache and host files (default: `DC_SAVE`, then `./save`, then `save/` beside the executable, then `save/` beside a local `data/`, then `$XDG_DATA_HOME/chronicle/save`); created on first use |
| `--headless` | SDL's offscreen video driver with `VK_EXT_headless_surface`, SDL's dummy audio driver, and the game clock unbounded (one tick per pump, no sleeping) |
| `--offscreen` | `--headless` without a Vulkan surface: frames are drawn to an image only (what `--headless` does by itself when the loader has no `VK_EXT_headless_surface`) |
| `--frames N` | stop after N frames of the game's main loop |
| `--screenshot PATH` | after the run, write the last tick's canonical image (or the loading screen's frame, if it presented since) to PATH as a PNG; never a display frame, so never the FPS counter |
| `--input FILE` | drive the pads from a script (default: `DC_INPUT`; see "Scripted input") |
| `--width W`, `--height H` | window size in pixels, over `config.json` (default: the monitor's resolution) |
| `--jump MODE[:MAP]` | test hook: start in a mode (see "Test hooks"); also `DC_JUMP` |
| `--fast-load` | test hook: loading-screen holds and fades of a few ticks; also `DC_FAST_LOAD=1` |
| `--display-per-tick N` | headless test aid: render N interpolated display frames per tick (offscreen, not presented) before presenting the tick's canonical image |
| `--show-fps` | draw the FPS counter when headless too (a headless run leaves `show_fps` off) |

Environment: `DC_DATA` and `DC_SAVE` (above), `DC_INPUT` (above), `DC_AUDIO=off` (no audio
device), `DC_AUDIO_WAV` and `DC_AUDIO_TRACE` (see "Audio"), `DC_VULKAN_VALIDATION` (enable the Khronos validation layer in a
release build; a debug build always asks for it), `DC_PRESENT_STATS=1` (print
draws per tick and render times at exit, and what the FPS counter said last
when it is on), and SDL's own variables.

Exit statuses (`port/src/exitcodes.hpp`): 0 when the window was closed or
`--frames` ran out, 1 when the window, the renderer or the screenshot failed,
2 for bad arguments, 3 when the data directory is missing or holds no file
and no disc was given at the first-run prompt (one line names it and the
`dcdata` command; a headless run checks before any window opens), 4 for a failed game assertion (retail's `__assert`, after the game's
own message: `LoadFile` prints `File open error "<path>"`). A `PS2_UNIMPLEMENTED`
stub aborts (SIGABRT) so a debugger or a core dump stops at it.

`<save>/config.json` (`port/src/platform/config.cpp`, read with
[nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json); `//` and `/* */` comments
are allowed, unknown keys and bad values are reported and ignored, and a file
that is not valid JSON is reported and leaves every default in place). When
there is no `config.json`, `darkcloud` creates one holding the defaults (the
file it writes has no comments). It prints `config: loaded <path>` when it
has read the file and `config: saved <path>` when it has written it. Every
key is optional; these are the defaults:

```

Discord Rich Presence (`port/src/presence.cpp`, `port/src/platform/discord.cpp`) speaks Discord's
local IPC protocol over its Unix socket (a named pipe on Windows), so it needs no Discord library. It shows the character
played and the town, or the dungeon and floor, and reconnects whenever Discord starts. Discord
names the game after Chronicle's Discord application, whose id is `kDiscordClientId`
(`platform/discord.hpp`); that application's Rich Presence art assets are `dark_cloud`, `chronicle` and one per character: `toan`, `xiao`, `goro`, `ruby`,
`ungaga` and `osmond`.

`video.detail_distance` is how far away town houses, villagers and dungeon
monsters keep their full detail; past it the game's own distances apply, so a
small value such as `1` is retail's behaviour. A town part within that
distance of the eye draws its finest level of detail (retail steps down from
300, 500 and 800 plus a share of the part's size). A villager within it of
the player steps and draws (retail: the two nearest in front of the camera,
within 150). A dungeon monster within it of the player draws and animates
while still dormant: it wakes, acts, and shows on the map only at its own
clip distance (300 unless its script sets one) and under retail's limit of
four awake at once. The overhead view of georama mode keeps its coarse
models, and the 1200 cull of far town parts is unchanged.

`video.shadow_distance` is how deep into the view a town part (a house, a
tree, a fixed part) casts its shadow at full strength; past it the game's own
distances apply, so a small value such as `1` is retail's behaviour. Retail
sorts the parts into two bands by their depth from the eye
(`ps2/src/editloop.cpp:2356`, `CEditGround::DrawShadow`): those nearer than
the map's `shadow_near` (320 unless its `SHADOW_LEVEL` says otherwise) darken
the ground by `shadow_mode` (0x34 of 0x80), those out to `shadow_far` (740) by
the fainter `shadow_mode_2` (0x20), and a part past that casts none, so a
shadow lightens and then goes as the camera backs away. A part deeper than
300 also takes the cheaper volume program, and one with a `draw_distance`
drops its shadow past it. A part within `shadow_distance` belongs to the near
band with the precise program (`port/src/editground.cpp`). The characters'
shadows have no such distances, the overhead view of georama mode keeps its
own faint shadows, and a map whose `SHADOW_LEVEL` is 0 still has none.

`video.vsync` is shorthand for `present_mode`: `true` is `fifo`, `false`
`immediate`. A binding is one name or a list of names. The `bindings` shown
are examples of the form (the defaults are in the table below); a
`config.ini` from an earlier build is not read, and `darkcloud` says so when
it finds one without a `config.json`.

The file is read once, at start. The Options screen (below) changes the
settings through `ConfigChange(config)` (`platform/config.hpp`): the settings
are taken as the file would read them back (a bad value is reported and
becomes its default), saved, and applied to the running game. The file is
rewritten whole, as `ConfigSerialize` writes it, so comments in it are not
kept; it is written to `config.json.tmp` and renamed over `config.json`, so a
crash or a full disk leaves the old file or the new one, never part of one.
Every setting applies at once except `game.debug_mode` (the initial value of
`DebugMode`), which takes effect at the next start (`ConfigAppliesOnRestart`
says which, for the screen to show):
the master volume, the input section (bindings, mouse and stick), the tick
rate, `interpolation`, `max_fps` and `show_fps`, the present mode (the
swapchain is recreated), the window's size and fullscreen state, and `aspect`
and `ui_scale` (at the next pump outside a frame: `gfx::SetFrameLayout`;
while the Options screen is open the interface stays at 100%, and
`ui_scale` takes over when it closes), and the `discord` section (Rich
Presence stops or starts).
`--width`, `--height` and `--show-fps` keep their hold over the file, and a
headless window keeps its size. The render scale stays the one the window
had at start, as after a resize by hand. Each part of the game that holds a
setting applies its own through a hook (`ConfigAddChangeHook`); `main.cpp`'s
is the host's. `ConfigChange` returns whether the file was saved, and the
same settings again retry a failed save without applying them again. It and
the hooks run on the main thread; a `ConfigChange` from inside a hook is
refused, and a hook added or removed during a change takes part from the
next one.

### Keyboard and mouse

The keyboard and the mouse drive pad 1 next to the first gamepad
(`port/src/platform/input.cpp`, `mouse.cpp`); a second gamepad is pad 2.
The defaults, and what the game does with each button (PAL, English: the
dungeon's `PadInput_OK` is cross and `PadInput_NO` circle,
`ps2/src/dun/gameloop.cpp:1666`):

| Input | Pad | What the game does with it |
|---|---|---|
| WASD | left stick | walk (`dun/gameloop.cpp:3006`, the town's `EdMoveChara`); menus with `MenuModeOn` turn it into the d-pad; d-pad as well where nothing reads the stick (below) |
| mouse motion | none | the camera, directly (see "Mouse look") |
| left click, Space | cross | attack, open, talk (`dun/gameloop.cpp:3585`, `editloop.cpp:3885`); confirm |
| right click, X | R1 | held while locked on: guard (`dun/gameloop.cpp:3347`, `guard_mode = 5` at :3374); unlocked, turns the camera (:4338) |
| F | circle | lock on to the nearest enemy or let go; with none in range, swing the camera behind the character (`dun/gameloop.cpp:3243`); back in menus |
| E | square | use the active item (`dun/gameloop.cpp:3775`); held, a feather's speed boost (:3745) |
| Tab | triangle | the menu (`dun/gameloop.cpp:3134`, `editloop.cpp:1824`) |
| Z | L1 | next lock-on target while locked on (`dun/gameloop.cpp:3260`); otherwise turns the camera (:4342) |
| Q | L2 | held, the camera behind the character (`dun/gameloop.cpp:4347`) |
| R | R2 | first-person look (`dun/gameloop.cpp:4354`) |
| C, Backspace | select | switch character (`dun/gameloop.cpp:3185`) |
| Return | start | pause (`dun/gameloop.cpp:3045`); the title's prompts |
| arrows | d-pad | left and right pick the active item in the dungeon (`dun/gameloop.cpp:3218`); menus |
| V; middle click, B | L3; R3 | debug and editor functions only |
| IJKL | right stick | the camera from the keyboard |
| F3 | none | the FPS counter on and off (see "The FPS counter") |
| gamepad L4 (`paddle2`) | none | the developer menu, in debug mode |
| gamepad R4 (`paddle1`) | none | the town or dungeon debug menu, in debug mode, without Select+L2 |
| gamepad L5 (`paddle4`) | none | held, the gyroscope turns the camera (`gyro` set to `held`) |

The square button is not a guard in this game: the guard is R1 held while
locked on, so right click is R1. The follow camera sits at
`follow + distance * (sin a, cos a)` (`camerafollow.cpp`) and the stick's
right is the screen's right (`move_x = lx cos a + ly sin a`), so a positive
RX, which lowers `a`, turns the view right, and a positive RY lowers the
camera, which looks up. Mouse right turns the view right and mouse up looks
up; `mouse_invert_y` flips the latter.

The actions are `up down left right cross circle square triangle l1 r1 l2
r2 l3 r3 start select lx- lx+ ly- ly+ rx- rx+ ry- ry+ lx ly rx ry`, and the
port's own `fps_toggle`, `developer_menu`, `debug_menu` and `gyro_hold`, which press no pad button. Keys are
SDL names (any case, `_` for a space; `Grave`, `Backquote` or `Backtick` for
the key left of 1); `Mouse1` to `Mouse5` are left, right,
middle and the two side buttons. The port's own actions also take
`Gamepad:<button>` with SDL's gamepad button names (`Gamepad:guide`,
`Gamepad:misc1`), on any connected gamepad; the pad actions take a gamepad's
buttons from the gamepad itself. A gamepad axis deflected past the game's
dead zone wins over the keyboard and mouse on that axis; buttons add.
Each key-down of a toggle's key counts once, however briefly it is held.

- **Sticks.** A key is full deflection; two keys at right angles make a
  diagonal of the same length. Values go through the inverse of the game's
  `AxisCalibration` (a dead zone of 49 above and 50 below the centre, then
  78 steps for 128), so a deflection reaches the game exactly and small
  mouse motion is not lost in the dead zone.
- **Gamepad sticks.** Each stick's deflection is scaled by `stick_sensitivity`
  (1.33, PCSX2's default) and stretched from the circle a modern stick reports
  onto the DualShock 2's square, keeping its direction: the game's dead zone
  takes 38% of the travel and the town runs past 0.85, so an unscaled stick
  only runs at over 90% tilt, and a round one never on a diagonal.
- **Gyro.** When `gyro` says (always, only in first-person view, or while
  `gyro_hold` is held), a gamepad's gyroscope turns the camera while the
  right stick is centred. Turning the pad left or right turns the view and tilting it looks up
  or down, `gyro_sensitivity` times the rate in radians per second; below 0.03
  is ignored as drift. `gyro_invert_x`/`_y` flip it, and `stick_invert_x`/`_y`
  flip the camera stick the same way.
- **First-person view.** R2's view, in a dungeon or outdoors in a town, reads
  only the left stick, so while it is on, the right stick and the gyro drive the left stick whenever
  the left stick itself is centred.
- **Mouse.** The mouse turns the camera itself ("Mouse look"), not the
  right stick. Binding `MouseX` or `MouseY` to `lx ly rx ry` makes it a
  stick again on that axis and takes that axis from the mouse look: the
  stick reads the motion since the previous read divided by the ticks
  between them, at the deflection that would turn the dungeon's camera
  (0.04 radians a tick at full deflection) as far as the mouse look does,
  times the binding's scale, and full deflection at most.
- **Capture.** With `mouse_capture`, SDL relative mode holds the cursor
  while the window has focus. Fullscreen startup captures when focus arrives,
  and focus regain restores capture. Losing focus releases it, and so does
  `mouse_release` (Escape) when the window is not fullscreen; a click in
  the window captures again and does nothing else. While released, motion
  and clicks do not reach the game. Without capture they always do, and
  the motion is the cursor's, after the system's pointer acceleration;
  captured, it is the mouse's raw counts (SDL's relative mode with
  `SDL_HINT_MOUSE_RELATIVE_SYSTEM_SCALE` off, unless the environment sets
  `SDL_MOUSE_RELATIVE_SYSTEM_SCALE`, which wins).
- **WASD on the d-pad.** The developer menu (`MenuLoop`) and the dungeon
  loader read only the d-pad and never call `MenuModeOn`; the dungeon reads
  the d-pad to pick the active item while WASD walks. So the movement keys
  also press the d-pad exactly when the game did not read pad 1's left
  stick (`CGamePad::GetLX`/`GetLY`, also called by `GetLXf`, `AllOn` and
  `UpDate`'s menu mode) between its last two pad reads.
  `port/src/gamepad.cpp` replaces `pad_button_read` and `GetLX`/`GetLY`
  with retail's bodies plus the notes the host needs, and routes pad 2
  debug button reads to pad 1. Menus with
  `MenuModeOn(120)` (the title, the language select, the save screens, the
  dungeon and town menus) read the stick, so the game's own conversion
  turns a full WASD deflection (128) into the d-pad; a diagonal (91 per
  axis) stays under their threshold, as a gamepad's does.

### First-person walking

In towns, interiors and dungeons, the keyboard movement bindings (WASD by default)
walk relative to the first-person view while the mouse looks around. A/D strafe;
W/S move forward/backward, at the interior walking speed. Diagonals keep the same
speed. Body collision, gravity, slopes, chests and Atla balls still constrain
movement. Input locks, menus, freezing, actions and scripted fades block walking.
Controller-only first-person look retains its retail controls.

### Mouse look

The mouse turns each camera the right stick turns, by the angle it moved:
`mouse_sensitivity` degrees per count, with no dead zone, no steps and no
full deflection to cap it (`port/src/camera_port.cpp`). The dungeon's,
the interior's and the georama view's cameras and the first-person views
read it in the stick's units, added to the stick's reading, so their own
conditions see both alike; the town's walk camera takes it apart (below). A
gamepad's stick is unchanged.

A follow camera eases towards its angle and its eye towards its place
(`CCameraFollow::Step`, `CCamera::Step`): a turn shows over a few tenths of
a second, and one past half a turn would go the short way round, backwards.
That suits the stick's small steady steps, not the mouse, so the mouse's
share of a turn is applied at once: when the camera's next `AddAngle` in the
same pad read is exactly the delta of the reading the mouse went into, the
port's replacement (`port/src/camerafollow.cpp`) turns the angle and the eye
about the point it looks at by that share immediately. Any other `AddAngle`
on that camera, or the next pad read, ends the reading unused; mouse and
stick that cancel turn nothing. The stick's share, the following of the
character and the game's own camera moves still ease.

The town's walk camera (`EdMoveChara`, walking and fishing) tests the walls
from where the eye is before the stick turns it, which allows for a stick's
small step but not for a mouse's whole turn: taken the same way, a fast turn
put the eye past a wall, and the camera then swung round behind it. So the
town's RX stays the stick's, and `EdGetRXf` records the mouse's turn in a
request `EditLoop` opens around the walk. After the camera's step, if the
same camera is still shown on the same ground, map and mode in the same pad
read, `EditLoop` applies the safe prefix of the mouse turn immediately. A
continuous clearance bound covers the look-ray fan and the eye's movement,
including pending positions and the remaining follow-camera easing corridor.
Intervals whose bound touches geometry are subdivided; clear endpoint samples
alone never authorize a turn. The eye keeps 10 units of clearance and the
floor query keeps 18 below it. An initially invalid corridor rejects the
mouse turn until the game repairs it; refused motion is dropped.

The port collector allocates a proven upper bound before calling each frame's
collector and includes all grid cells crossed by the sweep. Unknown collision
types, invalid dimensions, or work-budget exhaustion reject unvalidated motion.
Collection is limited to 32,768 polygons and 4,096 frame visits; each turn has
at most 4,096 interval checks and one million polygon checks. The camera can
stop earlier than the stick,
which may slide along a wall the town finds beside the eye. As RX no longer
carries the mouse, the drift behind a walking character and R1 and L1, which
wait for RX to rest, see only the stick: the camera can swing behind while
the mouse turns it.

Live motion is taken whole at each read of pad 1 (`InputLatchPad`, once per
pass of the main loop), so each count reaches the camera at one read
whatever the display's frames do between ticks; a pause in the reads longer
than a quarter of a second (a load) drops what came during it. A script's
`mouse:DX,DY` is the motion of each read.

Third-person mouse pitch changes the follow camera's height while it keeps
looking at the player. It does not rotate the view independently of the player.
Height requests stay inside the gameplay limits. The return toward the baseline
pauses while either mouse axis moves. **Vertical Return**, under Options >
Controls, sets the idle return speed: Off, Very Slow, Slow (the default, one fifth
of retail), Moderate or Retail. A custom `input.mouse_camera_return` from 0 to 1
can be set in the configuration file and takes effect without a restart. Floor and
wall correction and the automatic horizontal swing behind a walking player
retain their retail behavior.

Optional **Mouse Wheel Zoom**, under Options > Controls, changes the distance
from the player: wheel up moves closer, wheel down farther. **Reset Zoom**
defaults to middle mouse; Controls offers middle mouse, either side button,
Home or Disabled. Other bindings can be set with `input.bindings.zoom_reset`.
With zoom enabled its reset binding takes priority over conflicting pad
bindings; disabling zoom restores normal input behavior. Reset restores the
town's normal distance or the dungeon camera's starting distance, as far as
geometry allows. Zoom is limited to 30–2000 world units, follows normal camera
easing and validates the entire pending distance corridor. Dungeon zoom retains
ten-unit wall clearance and five-unit floor clearance for its normally lower
eye. Collision can limit the requested distance and restore it when clear.
Menus, first-person views, Georama, fishing, lock-on and scripted cameras do
not consume wheel zoom input. The feature is off by default.

| View | Horizontal | Vertical |
|---|---|---|
| dungeon (`DunMoveChara`) | `AddAngle(0.04 * -turn)` | camera height, `AddHeight(-ry)`, at most 30 |
| dungeon, first person (R2, `EyeCamera`) | heading, beside the left stick | pitch, inside retail's -1 to 0.65 |
| town (`EdMoveChara`, `EdGetRXf`/`EdGetRYf`, `EditLoop`) | the eye turned after the step, as far as it stays clear of walls | camera height while under 30, the mouse raising it to 30 at most |
| town, first person (R2, `EyeCamera`) | heading, beside the left stick | pitch, inside -1 to 0.65 |
| interior (`MoveCamera`, `edit_in.cpp`) | `AddAngle(0.04 * -horizontal)` | camera height, at most 30 |
| interior, first person (`EyeCamera`) | the character's heading, which the view follows, beside both sticks | pitch, inside -1 to 0.65 |
| georama (`MoveCamera`, `editloop.cpp`) | `AddAngle(0.03 * -horizontal)` | none: the view sets its height each frame |

Vertical motion on a follow camera, which has a height rather than a pitch,
changes the height by what tilts the line from the eye to the point it
circles by the mouse's angle (`MouseLookTiltHeight`). It changes only the
height the camera is going to, as the stick does, and eases: the game's
corrections bound that height afterwards (the dungeon at least 1.6, and 25
over the floor under the eye; the town 18 over it where the floor is level
enough), and the mouse raises it to 30 at most, the player's limit. It is not
a free pitch: looking up from the default view moves the camera little, and
the dungeon moves its height on its own (`autoCamTrial`), so a raised dungeon
camera drifts back. A first-person view takes the mouse only while it is
shown, and its heading stays within half a turn. The developer cameras (`EdDMoveCamera`,
the item viewer) and the event script's `GET_APAD` read the stick alone.

### Scripted input

`--input FILE` (`port/src/platform/input_script.cpp`) replaces the pads with
a script, through `InputSetOverride`. Each line is

```
<frame> [pad1|pad2] [button ...] [key:NAME ...] [mouseN ...] [mouse:DX,DY] [wheel:NOTCHES] [lx ly rx ry]
```

and holds the named buttons (`cross circle square triangle start select l1
r1 l2 r2 l3 r3 up down left right`, any case) and the four stick bytes
(0-255, centred at 128 when left out) on that pad, pad 1 unless the line
says `pad2`, from that frame until the pad's next line. On pad 1 lines,
`key:NAME` (an SDL key name, `_` for a space), `mouse1` to `mouse5` and
`mouse:DX,DY` (counts per tick) go through the keyboard and mouse bindings
and the mouse look as live input does, d-pad rule included, and reach
`fps_toggle` too: a line that starts holding `key:F3` is one press of it. A line with no
button releases everything. Frames count the game's main loop as
`--frames` does; frame 0 also covers the 60-tick warm-up and the loading
screens before the first frame. `#` starts a comment; a pad's frames must
not decrease. Pad 1 is held released until its first line; pad 2 keeps its
device unless a line names it. A bad script stops `darkcloud` with status 2
before the window opens. `GamePad.Down` fires on a press edge, so a press
needs a later line that releases it:

```
# language select (English), attract movie, title logo, menu
0
70 cross
75
90 cross
95
200 start
205
480 start
485
520 start
525
```

reaches the title menu at frame 560.

### Test hooks

For tests and debugging only; nothing the game does depends on them.

- `--jump MODE[:MAP]` (or `DC_JUMP`) sets `DebugMode`, skips the 60-tick warm-up
  and the developer menu, and starts `RunGame` in the mode with the globals the
  developer menu (and for a dungeon, the dungeon loader) would have left:
  `edit:<map>` (the game's `MapNo`: 0-4 the five towns, 11 and up the sub maps,
  99 the interior), `dungeon:<n>` (dungeon n, 0-6, as `MapJump(200 + n)`, at its
  floor select), `title`, `rush` (the attract movie), `opening`, or `menu` (the
  developer menu itself). A bad value exits with status 2.
- `--fast-load` (or `DC_FAST_LOAD=1`) cuts the loading screen's start delay to
  one tick, its fades to two or four ticks and its holds (PAL 120, 183 and 83
  ticks) to two. The modes' own fades are untouched.

`darkcloud --headless --jump dungeon:0 --fast-load --frames 60` shows the first
dungeon's floor select after about five seconds on lavapipe.

### Developer menu

PAL retail's `main` sets `DebugMode` when pad 2 holds L1+R1+L2+R2 through
the warm-up; the game then starts in `GAME_MODE_MENU`, the developer menu
(`MenuLoop`, `ps2/src/main.cpp`), instead of the language select, and leaves
pad 2 unlocked. The port takes `DebugMode` from `game.debug_mode` in
`config.json`, which is off by default. The port starts at the language select
whether this flag is true or false. Setting it to true enables debug controls
from startup; the debug toggle chord can also enable them during play.
`darkcloud` prints `debug mode on` when the flag starts enabled. An explicit
`--jump menu` opens the developer menu at startup.

While `DebugMode` is set, Start and Select on pad 1 go to the developer menu
at once from every mode: the language select, the attract movie, the
title, the opening, a town or an interior, the dungeon loader, a dungeon
and the save screen (`GameDeveloperMenuRequested`,
`port/src/gameloop.cpp`, after every frame of the main loop). The frame the
second of the two goes down ends the mode where it stands: there is no fade
and the town is not saved back to the save data; sound stops, the pad is
unlocked and a pending map jump or start event is dropped
(`GameEnterDeveloperMenu`). The chord is read from the host's pad, past the
game's pad lock, so it works in events and fades; the loading screen between
two modes and the fades a town presents on its own run to their end first.
Holding it into the next mode does nothing until it is pressed again.

After start-up, retail PAL flips `DebugMode` after every frame of the main
loop where pad 2 holds L1+R1+L2+R2 and R3 is pressed (`ps2/src/main.cpp:963`);
the port reads the same combination on pad 1 instead (`GameCheckDebugToggle`,
past the game's pad lock), printing
`debug mode on` or `debug mode off`. It does not move the game anywhere:
`DebugMode` is a flag the modes read. What it does once set:

- The town (`EditLoop`, `ps2/src/editloop.cpp:2041`) and the dungeon
  (`GameLoop`, `ps2/src/dun/gameloop.cpp:2087`) leave on Select held with
  Start (in the town after a fade); their loop results send the game to
  `GAME_MODE_MENU` (`GameApplyLoopResult`: the town's result 1, any dungeon
  result), and the top of `main`'s loop runs the developer menu there only
  while `DebugMode` is set (otherwise the attract movie, `ps2/src/main.cpp:571`).
  These are retail's own ways back, which the port's Start and Select
  (above) now takes ahead of: the interior's (`EditInLoop`) went to the
  title, not the menu.
- In the town Select+L2+L3 shows the editor's debug overlay and
  Select+L2+R3 opens its debug menu (`editloop.cpp:1849`); in an interior
  Select walks out of the door (`edit_in.cpp:1342`); in the dungeon
  Select+L2+R3 opens the debug options outside an event
  (`dun/gameloop.cpp:3109`); a town event pauses on Start and stops on
  Select+L2+R3 (`editloop3.cpp:8678`); shops, menus and battles have their own, some
  using the retail pad 2 button checks.
- Nothing on the language select, the attract movie, the title or the
  opening reads it; the port's Start and Select is the one thing that works
  there.

The PC port routes the game's `On2` and `Down2` button checks to pad 1 only
while `DebugMode` is on and **Select+L2 are held**. Hold those two buttons, then
press the shortcut shown below. Physical pad 2 buttons no longer activate
these shortcuts. L3 and R3 editor/debug menu presses also require Select+L2.
Ordinary button reads still use pad 1 without PAL's pad 2 Start/Select
overrides. While Select+L2 is held, Cross and Circle presses go to debug
shortcuts without triggering their ordinary menu actions. Other debug buttons
may also perform their ordinary actions. The separate
L1+R1+L2+R2 then R3 debug toggle and Start+Select developer menu shortcut
retain their existing behavior.

| Screen or mode | Buttons after holding Select+L2 | Debug action |
|---|---|---|
| Town and interior | L3/R3 | Show the debug overlay or open/close its menu |
| Dungeon | R3 | Open the debug options menu outside events |
| Town event | R3 | Stop the event |
| Town/editor | Square; D-pad Down/Up/Left/Right | Clear events; stop time, set the next hour, or move time backward/forward |
| Town ground editor | Cross/Circle/Triangle | Clear, save, or load ground data |
| Town event | Cross | Skip the paused event |
| Interior | Square | Clear events |
| Dungeon | Cross/Square | Toggle step hold or battle display clearing |
| Dungeon entrance | R1; Cross/Circle held | Unlock all floors; raise/lower the selected floor's kill count |
| Dungeon character change | Cross | Add a Stand-In Powder to the inventory |
| Character menu | Cross/Circle | Add/remove a party member |
| Weapon list | Cross; R1 or R2; Triangle; Circle; Square | Raise level; set weapon flags; max weapon stats; reset flags; cycle element and monster values |
| Weapon stats | D-pad Right/Left; Cross/Circle; Triangle | Raise/lower the selected stat or durability; max selected stat |
| Item/character status | Cross/Circle/Square/Triangle held | Adjust life, defense, water, or money according to the selected row |
| Debug item list | Cross | Grant all eligible weapons |
| World map | Cross | Mark the next unvisited place or dungeon as visited |
| Shop boards | Triangle/Cross held; R1/R2 | Add/remove 1,000 Gilda; print board data with R1 (R2 has no visible result) |
| Shop transaction | D-pad Up/Down held | Raise/lower the party's Gilda one point per frame |
| Shop held item | D-pad Up | Print the selected item's data |
| Fishing menus | Triangle; Cross/Circle held | Record a Mardan Garayan catch; raise/lower prize points |
| Fishing records | Cross | Record a random catch |
| Town parts board | Cross/Circle/R1/L1/Triangle; Cross+Circle; Cross+Down | Fill, empty, dump, or complete parts, including all parts and NPC flags |
| Save screen | R1/Triangle/Cross/L3; Cross+Circle | Start card unformat, format, write test, or conversion; unformat selected card |
| Opening book | Cross | Finish the opening book animation |
| Item model viewer | Circle; Triangle/Square held | Close the viewer; enlarge/shrink its model |

Where a debug button is also an ordinary menu button, actions other than
Cross and Circle can still run alongside the debug shortcut.

In the developer menu, up and down (pad 1) pick a row,
left and right change its number, circle or triangle enters it:

| Row | Goes to |
|---|---|
| game start | the attract movie (`MapNo` 801), then the title |
| `e0N` | the town `N` (1-5; `main_select_menu_no` N-1, `GAME_MODE_EDIT`) |
| `sN` | the sub map `N` (map number N+10, `GAME_MODE_EDIT`); R1/L1 step by ten |
| interior | map 99, `GAME_MODE_EDIT` |
| dungeon | the dungeon loader (`LoaderLoop`): up and down pick one of the seven dungeons, circle, cross or start enters floor 1 |
| opening | the opening (`GAME_MODE_OPENING`, scenes op_a to op_d) |
| `eventN` | one of three story events (map 23 event 310, map 41 event 150, map 19 event 305) |
| `memory card N` | the save screen in mode N |
| `Language N` | sets `LanguageCode` (PAL default 2, British English) |

```
0 down

with `--jump menu` enters town 1 (Norune); `0 key:grave` with `1` releasing it
does the same from the keyboard.

## Start-up and the main loop

`port/src/main.cpp` is the executable's `main`. In order: `PathsConsumeArgs`
takes `--data`/`--save` out of argv; the other options are parsed; the data
directory is checked; `ConfigLoad` reads `config.json`; `WindowInit` opens the
window (size and fullscreen from the config, offscreen when headless);
`InputInit`; `gfx::RendererInit` with the config's present mode, the pipeline
cache at `<save>/pipeline_cache.bin` and a progress callback that prints
`compiling shaders n/total` at quarters; `AudioOutputStart` pulls
`audio::DefaultMixer()` at its rate with the config's master gain; the clock
gets the config's tick rate (unbounded when headless); a pump hook is
installed that pumps window events (a close request stops the game) and
samples input and applies a pending frame layout; the config change hook
is added; then `RunGame`. After it returns: the screenshot, then
`AudioOutputStop`, `InputShutdown`, `RendererShutdown`, `WindowShutdown`.
`main.cpp` also forwards the names MWCC gives the calls in retail `main`
(below).

`RunGame` (`port/src/gameloop.cpp`) is retail `main` (`ps2/src/main.cpp`)
with the hardware taken out, line for line otherwise:

- `init_all` is reduced to `InitCDFile`, `MGInit`, `InitMemoryFile`,
  `BufferAllClear`, `InitReadBG`: no IOP reboot or module loads, no
  `sceCdInit`/`sceCdMmode`/`sceFsReset`, no `DevInit` DMA reset or channel
  handles. `mwInit` is not called; the host has run the static constructors.
- Every `sceGsSyncV` wait is `ClockSyncV()`; Timer 0, the DMA channel kick,
  `sceGsSyncPath` and the `FlushCache` calls go.
- The two uploads of `My_dma_start0` (the GS environment chain) and
  `Vu_progmain` (VU1 microcode) around a mode's `Init` become `LoadDrawEnv`,
  which sets the one register of `My_DrawEnv` the renderer still reads,
  TEXA (TA0 0x80, AEM 1, TA1 0x80).
- Per frame, `SetEnv` (replaced in `gameloop.cpp`) resets TEST, ZBUF and
  ALPHA to mglib's shadows as retail's A+D packet did, and the window
  rectangle to the full frame, which `sceGsSwapDBuff`'s draw environment did;
  TEX1 is read where a texture is bound and CLAMP is the sampler's.
  `sceVif1PkCall(Vu_prog0f)` goes.
- `save_data` and `config_data` are static in retail's unit, so `RunGame` has
  its own and reaches the rest through `SaveData`, as retail does.
- Mode 12's loop reads a register nothing set; the port's zero keeps it
  running.
- The transitions are `GameApplyLoopResult` (what each mode's loop result
  does) and `GameFollowMapJump` (`NextMapNo` into the next mode), exported for
  the tests.
- The language select goes straight on to the attract movie: retail's memory
  card check (`GAME_MODE_MEMORY_CHECK`, `MemCheckLoop`) is never entered, as
  there is no card (see "Saves and host files").
- Each pass of the loop is one logic tick, recorded and rendered as described
  in "Ticks and display frames" below.
- `--frames` counts frames of this loop (one per `MGEndFrame` it calls);
  `RunGame` returns `kExitOk` at the top of the next frame once the budget
  is spent or a stop was requested, outside any frame, so the last frame can
  be read back. Presents a mode makes itself (`EditLoop`'s fades) and the
  loading screen's are not counted.

### Ticks and display frames

The game logic runs at the fixed tick rate; the window is presented at its own
rate, with motion interpolated between ticks (`port/src/gfx/README.md`,
"Display lists"):

1. `MGBeginFrame` starts recording the tick's display list: what the game draws,
   copies and uploads is appended to the list rather than executed.
2. `MGEndFrame` seals it and `GameRenderTick` (`gameloop.cpp`) renders it once,
   in full, as the tick's canonical image. That image is what the next tick's
   `MGGetFBuffBackTex` / `kPreviousFrame` samples and what frame copies and
   `mgPickZBuff` read, and every copy, blit, texture or palette update in the
   list (frame grabs into `frame_image` and `water`, texture animation,
   `MGMoveImage`, `MGStretchMoveImage`) runs there, once per tick. The
   previous-frame effects (the title's trail, water, depth of field) are
   therefore tick-exact whatever the display rate.
3. `MGEndFrame` then waits for the next tick as before (`mgWaitVSync`, the
   count, the callbacks and every spin on the clock are unchanged), and while
   it waits `GamePresentBetweenTicks` renders display frames from the last two
   lists at alpha = the elapsed fraction of the tick and presents them, as fast
   as `present_mode` and `max_fps` allow. A display frame replays the newest
   list's drawing only, into its own image, with each `CFrame`'s model matrix
   (`frame_draw.cpp` tags its draws with the frame's address; a visual drawn
   outside one with its record) and the camera interpolated between the two
   ticks. A frame drawn at several places in a tick (a town's tiles and parts
   share theirs) is matched place by place, not in draw order. A tick that did not wait, or presented nothing, presents its
   canonical image.

A grab of the frame that the tick draws back (the depth of field's blur, the water)
is taken again by each display frame from its own image, so it lines up with the
interpolated scene; the game's texture keeps the tick's grab. A cloth is blended
vertex by vertex unless one moved more than 10 units in the tick, which is where
`CCloth::Step` stops simulating and carries the grid along.

What a display frame does not interpolate: 2D (the HUD is tick-exact), 3D
sprites (2D quads with depth), skinned poses, objects that moved more than
`kDraw3DTeleportDistance` (200 units) in a tick, a camera that moved more than
200 units or turned more than 45 degrees, and the first tick of every mode
(`RunGame` cuts there). `interpolation = off` presents each canonical image once,
which is the PS2's picture at the tick rate. Headless runs (unbounded clock)
present one canonical image per tick, so screenshots are those images.

The loading screen still presents from the idle hook as immediate frames; once
it has, display frames stop until the next tick's canonical render.

### The FPS counter

With `video.show_fps` (on by default; `fps_toggle`, F3, flips it at any
time), every presented frame carries one line at the window's top-left
corner, in the port's own 5x7 font (`port/src/platform/overlay.cpp`, white
on a translucent black backdrop, on whole pixels: one per logical unit,
rounded):

```
FPS 143.9  TICK 60.0/60  DRAWS 412
```

the frames presented per second and the logic ticks rendered per second,
each over the last half second or so, the configured tick rate, and the
newest tick's mesh and 2D draws. It is drawn with `gfx::Draw2D` into a
display list of its own, recorded only when the text or the window's mapping
changes, never into a tick's list: a display frame draws it after the tick's
list and before the present (`gfx::RenderOptions::overlay`), and a tick
presented as its canonical image is presented as a display render of the
counter alone, which starts from that image. So the canonical image, which
`kPreviousFrame`, frame copies, pick-Z and `--screenshot` read, never holds
it, and screenshots are the same byte for byte with it on or off. The
loading screen's own presents do not carry it. Headless runs leave it off
unless `--show-fps` is given.

A display frame costs what drawing the tick costs on the GPU, plus little on the
CPU: in the opening's first scene (about 2,100 mesh draws and 100 2D draws per
tick, all of them keyed), a release build spends 1.6 ms interpolating and 1.8 ms
replaying a list, and lavapipe about 150 ms rasterising it at 1280x960. The
canonical render is the frame the port drew before, and the only one that pays
for copies and readbacks. The first dungeon's floor B1 draws about 265 mesh and 145 2D
draws a tick (at most 666). `darkcloud --headless --display-per-tick 4` leaves
every screenshot of the title, the attract movie, the opening and that floor
byte for byte the same.

Overlays are not re-initialised: `TITLE.BIN` and `DUN.BIN` are linked in
once, where retail reloaded the overlay's data, zeroed its `.bss` and re-ran
its static constructors on every switch between the title and the dungeon.
`LoadOverlay` only rebuilds the title objects the port defines with host
classes ("The title overlay's own class declarations"). A mode that relies
on fresh overlay globals is a known gap (below).

Each mode's loop result is applied by the mode that ran the loop
(`GameApplyLoopResult(old_main_mode, result)`), as retail handles it inside
that mode's `case`: the developer menu sets `mode` itself and returns 1.

## Platform

`port/src/platform`, `port/src/gfx` and `port/src/audio` are the host side.
They build as `dc_host` without `port.h` or the game's include paths, so no
game header or SDK type reaches them. Game types meet them only in the
replacement units.

- **Window** (`platform/window`): SDL3 window, resizable, high pixel density,
  optionally fullscreen; `WindowSetMode` changes its size and fullscreen
  state as the config does at start. It leaves a window already in that
  mode alone, asks a size only of a window out of fullscreen and not
  maximized, and gives back the mode it asked for and the mode the window
  then has, since SDL may refuse a step or not finish it before
  `SDL_SyncWindow` gives up; `WindowTakeModeEvent` says the window entered or
  left fullscreen or changed size since. `WindowPollEvents` pumps events,
  reports a close, and forwards pixel-size changes to the renderer.
  `WindowAddEventHook` lets input see every event.
- **Input** (`platform/input`, `platform/mouse`, `sce/libpad.cpp`,
  `gamepad.cpp`): two DualShock 2-shaped pads from SDL gamepads, the
  keyboard and the mouse, with rumble. libpad's nine
  functions read them: buttons active-low in bytes 2-3, sticks in 4-7,
  `scePadGetState` stable, `scePadInfoMode` DualShock. `InputSetOverride`
  replaces a pad for tests.
- **Clock** (`platform/clock`): the stand-in for the VSync interrupt. One
  tick is one VSync, the count is the number of tick periods since the
  anchor, and the game's tick callback (`PlayTimeCount` or the loading
  screen) runs inside `ClockPump`, once per elapsed tick. Every retail spin
  on the interrupt pumps (`sceGsSyncV`, `WaitVSync`, `check_now_loading`,
  `wait_now_loading_vsync`, `ReadBGSync`, `MGEndFrame`). After the ticks a
  pump runs the pump hooks (the host's, added with `ClockAddPumpHook`: the
  window and input) and then the single idle hook (the game side's,
  `ClockSetIdleHook`: the loading screen's presenter), so spin-waits keep the
  window alive and the pads fresh whatever the loading screen does.
  `sceGsSyncV` returns the parity of the tick, as the interlaced field
  alternated: `CGamePad::Init` and `main` spin until it reads 1. The tick
  rate is a setting (60 Hz by default); presentation is not tied to it (below).
  `ClockWaitNextTick(hook)` runs a hook over and over while it waits, with the
  elapsed fraction of the tick; `MGEndFrame` presents display frames through it.
- **Config** (`platform/config`) and **paths** (`platform/paths`): above.
- **Overlay** (`platform/overlay`): the port's 5x7 font (the first-run screen
  draws with it too), a line of text drawn with `gfx::Draw2D` on whole pixels
  at the window's corner and recorded as a display list of its own, and the
  rate meter behind the FPS counter ("The FPS counter").
- **Audio output** (`platform/audio`): an SDL3 float stereo stream that pulls
  frames from a render callback on SDL's audio thread; `DC_AUDIO=off` or no
  device leaves the game silent.

## Rendering

`port/src/gfx` is a Vulkan 1.3+ renderer: one graphics queue that presents,
two frames in flight, dynamic rendering, synchronization2, a bindless texture
array, every pipeline created at start-up against the on-disk pipeline
cache, reverse-Z D32 depth with stencil, an immediate 2D API in the game's 640x480 logical
space (centred in the window) and a mesh API in 3D, named render targets,
copies, blits, depth readback and screenshots. `port/src/gfx/README.md` is its
contract: spaces, colour and alpha units, how the GS blend equation maps to
Vulkan blending and where it does not.

### Window aspect

The logical 640x480 frame is centred in the window at `min(W / 640, H / 480)`
pixels per unit, so the HUD keeps its place relative to the frame at any window
shape. With `video.aspect` `auto` the rest of the window is not bars:

- **3D.** `Draw3DEyeToClip` (`mglib.cpp`) maps the game's projection, logical
  `(320 + 800 x / z, 240 + 800 y / z)` (`MGSetRenderInfo`'s scale over the
  frame's 240 half-rows), through the target's logical mapping. The frame's rows
  fill the window's height, so the vertical field of view is retail's
  (2 atan(240 / 800), 33.4 degrees) and the horizontal one is
  2 atan(240 W / H / 800): 16:9 shows 107 logical units more on each side. A
  window narrower than 4:3 keeps the frame's width (retail's horizontal field of
  view) and shows more above and below, so the HUD always fits.
- **Culls.** `frame_draw.cpp`'s screen-bound test and `MGClipVertex` (so
  `MGClipBox`) take their half extents from what the current target shows
  (`Draw3DVisibleExtent`, from `gfx::VisibleLogicalRect`) instead of 320 by 240:
  a model past the 4:3 edge is drawn at 16:9 and dropped at 4:3. The GS guard
  band (2048 units about the centre) is far outside any window's extent and is
  unchanged.
- **2D** stays in logical space. Full-frame 2D (fades, the screen filter's
  `MGFillBox`, the previous-frame feedback, frame grabs drawn back; the loading
  screen clears the whole window) reaches the window's edges by the rule in
  `port/src/gfx/README.md`, "Aspect": an untextured or frame-image rectangle that
  reaches an edge of the frame from inside is carried to the window's edge;
  textured HUD pieces and 4:3 pictures (the floor select's backdrop) are not.
  `video.ui_scale` scales the depthless 2D about the window's centre.
- **HUD.** The pieces that sit by an edge of the frame keep their distance to
  that edge of the window instead, at their own size (`gfx::UiAnchor`,
  `port/src/gfx/README.md`, "Aspect"): the dungeon's status panel (life, weapon
  and water to the top left, the quick items top centre, the floor plate and the
  mini map to the top right, the weapon's portrait and gauge to the bottom left;
  `DrawGame`, `port/src/dun/gameloop.cpp`) and the town's clock (top right;
  `EdDrawClock`, `port/src/editloop.cpp`). Menus, message windows, the Georama
  editor's panels and 2D placed from 3D projections stay in the frame.
- **Frame grabs** (`frame_image`, `frame_buff` and the other `frame_*`
  placeholders, and the water's `water` and `water_buff`; `MGPortFrameTarget`)
  are as wide as the window, so what they hold and draw back includes the
  sides; the canonical and display images are the window's size. The game's
  other 640xN targets (`blender`, `shadow_buf`) keep their size at the render
  scale.
- **Depth of field** (`DepthOfField`, `port/src/effectmacro.cpp`; the towns'
  heat haze is its jittered second pass) is not retail's two shrunk copies of
  the whole frame, which blurred whatever stood in front of a focus plane into
  the scenery behind it and came back as blocks. Each pass blurs only what
  lies beyond its own plane: the frame is drawn into a target sharing its
  depth buffer under the plane's depth test (the rest stays transparent
  black, so the image is premultiplied by its coverage). Ordinary depth of
  field then uses half-size and quarter-size copies. Heat haze keeps both
  images at the frame's full pixel resolution and moves their sampling
  positions without a low-resolution copy. The images are laid back in
  retail's bands, the frame first scaled down by the image's coverage and
  the image then added. They are as wide as what the target shows, so the
  blur and the haze reach the window's edges;
  the two outermost haze columns do not wander, which on the PS2 left a
  ragged strip of the sharp frame in the overscan. For heat haze, eight depth
  samples build a gradual coverage mask around each focus distance. The
  bands also test against depth at the front of that range, keeping nearby
  objects sharp while the background haze fades in. `frame_image` is no
  longer written.
- **Water** (`port/src/water_draw.cpp`) refracts the frame at its own
  resolution instead of the game's field copy, and only from where water
  shows: a ripple's sample that lands on a bank or a character in front of the
  water gives way to the pixel's own colour. `MGMoveImage` takes a whole
  picture of the frame beside the game's copy (`Draw3DFramePicture`); the
  surface is drawn flat into a target sharing the frame's depth buffer (what
  the water covers), the rippled samples of that are laid over a second flat
  drawing by their coverage, and the frame takes the result with the game's
  colour and blend. Every sample is taken where the vertex lands
  (`gfx::kMeshScreenUv`), so it follows a display render's camera and reaches
  the window's sides. A surface drawn with no frame copy to hand, or into
  another target, samples the game's copy as before.
- **The title's backdrops** are built for the frame's width: the title
  screen's sky model, its cloud (whose animation parks spheres just outside
  the frame's sides; it is spread across, not enlarged) and the attract
  movie's turning title card are drawn larger by as much as the view is wider
  (`TitlePortBackdropScale`, `port/src/title/title_port.cpp`).
- **The FPS counter** is the host's and is never carried past the frame
  (`gfx::RenderOptions::host`).
- **Game logic** is unchanged: `MGRotTransPers*` answer in retail's GS and
  logical coordinates, which land on the meshes through the same mapping (the
  dungeon's lock-on corners, the town's edit cursor and name tags).

`aspect = 4:3` letterboxes everything as before, byte for byte. Known
differences at other aspects: game code that
drops 2D it projects outside 0..640 (effects, name tags) still does; at a
`ui_scale` other than 1 the 2D the game places from 3D projections moves with
the HUD.

The game's drawing reaches it through replacement units, in four groups that
share small internal headers:

- **`mglib_port.hpp`** (`mglib.cpp`, `mglib_port.cpp`, `mglib_math.cpp`):
  every `MG*` function. The GS register shadows the game sets
  (`MGSetGsTEST/ZBUF/ALPHA/TEXA`, `MGSetWindowRect`, and the clears, fills
  and stretches that leave them set) become the current `gfx::DrawState`
  (`MGPortDrawState`); GS 12.4 coordinates and 24-bit Z convert into logical
  space and reverse-Z (`MGPortLogicalX/Y`, `MGPortDepth`); TBP0 0 and 0xFFF
  stand for the frame and the previous frame. The VSync group (`MGInit`,
  `MGInitVSyncCallBack`, `MGGetVSyncCount`, `MGBeginFrame`, `MGEndFrame`,
  `MGFlipWaitVSync`) sits on the clock; `MGBeginFrame` starts recording a
  tick, `MGEndFrame` renders it, presents between ticks and keeps retail's
  "do not wait twice" rule. Pick-Z reads the canonical render's depth buffer.
  `MGSetRenderInfo` keeps retail's matrices; the field squeeze is undone
  where the game's rects reach the renderer.
- **`texture_port.hpp`** (`texture.cpp`, `texture_port.cpp`,
  `textureanime.cpp`, `nowload.cpp`): TIM2 (IDTEX4, IDTEX8, RGB16/24/32,
  mip levels, the IM2 swizzle undone) decoded into renderer textures with
  index textures and 256-entry palettes; a registry keyed by unique TBP0/CBP
  values so any TEX0 the game hands around resolves to one image;
  placeholder names (`#name#w#h#bpp`) become named render targets; texture
  animation and CLUT swaps are copies. The loading screen draws from the
  idle hook, never inside a frame the game has open.
  `CleanUpTextureList` does not compact the table: a native visual holds a
  table index where retail's packet holds a baked TEX0, so entries stay put
  and a reloaded block fills the first available holes rather than being
  appended after compaction. A name lookup across all blocks, which prefers
  the highest entry, can therefore pick differently from retail when two
  live blocks share a texture name.
- **`draw2d_port.hpp`** (`snd.cpp`, `gameutil_sprite.cpp`, `clsmes.cpp`,
  `spritetable.cpp`, `dispctrl.cpp`, `editloop_sprite.cpp`): the sprite
  primitives, `SetClut`, message windows, sprite tables and the debug font
  as glyph quads, mapped into the current target (render targets hold field
  rows).
- **`draw3d.hpp`** (`frame_draw.cpp`, `visualvu1.cpp`, `visualshadow.cpp`,
  `cloth_draw.cpp`, `water_draw.cpp`, the `*_math.cpp` units): MDT data built
  into meshes keyed by the game's vu_data block (the record dies with the
  block), `DrawVu1` submitting meshes with the constants the VU1 header
  carried (matrices, four lights, ambient, material, fog), shadow volumes
  extruded to the shadow plane and counted into `shadow_buf` against the
  scene's depth, then composited, cloth rebuilt per draw, water sampling the
  last frame copy. The assembly functions (`MulMatrix`, `MotionProc2`,
  `CCloth::Step`, the shadow CLIP builder and the rest) are C++ with the
  lanes retail writes.
- The long tail on top of those: `dun/gameloop.cpp` (`DunMainDraw`,
  `LoaderLoop`), `effectmacro.cpp`, `runeffect.cpp`, `fireomni.cpp`,
  `fishing.cpp`, `shot_freefuncs.cpp`, `battlemenu.cpp`, `clothread.cpp`,
  `langset.cpp`, and `editloop_init.cpp` (`EditInit`, its town objects
  carved out of `EtcDataBuffer` at host sizes where retail's quadword counts
  are the PS2's).

## Audio

All music and effects are sequenced. `port/src/audio` decodes VAG ADPCM,
parses HD banks and SQ sequences, and runs a sixteen-port MIDI player into a
48-voice synth with envelopes and an approximated reverb (`audio::Mixer`).
`port/src/sound.cpp` replaces `CSound` (bank and sequence transfers, play,
stop, fades, volumes, effect messages) on that mixer, and
`gameutil_midi.cpp` answers the EZMIDI RPC commands for anything that still
sends them. `main` starts the output; `CSound::Init` starts it too if it is
not running.

The formats and the synth's arithmetic were checked against every bank and
sequence on the PAL disc and against the IOP modules the game loads
(`EZMIDI.IRX`, `MODMIDI.IRX`, `MODHSYN.IRX`):

- **SQ** (`sq.cpp`): `SCEIVers`, `SCEISequ`, then `SCEIMidi` with a song table
  (offsets from the chunk) whose blocks start with a 32-bit data offset (always
  6) and a 16-bit division (always 480). The events are SMF-like with running
  status, but a note-off carries only its note number, and bit 7 on a channel
  message's last data byte means the next event has no delta. All 93
  sequences parse to their end-of-track meta exactly at the chunk's end.
- **Loops** (`sequencer.cpp`): NRPN 0 (`B0 63 00`) with data entry `n` opens loop
  `n` just after that data entry; NRPN 1 with data entry `n` and data entry LSB
  (controller 38) `c` jumps back `c` more times, forever for 0. Every sequence
  on the disc has one endless loop.
- **HD** (`hdbank.cpp`): the `SCEIHead` addresses, 36-byte programs, 20-byte
  splits, 4+2n-byte sample sets, 42-byte samples and 8-byte VAG entries as
  laid out there. Split bend ranges and every detune are in 128ths of a
  semitone (most splits say 0x600, an octave). A sample set's first byte picks
  a velocity curve (linear, inverse, squared and their mirrors). A sample's
  last byte is its SPU attribute: bits 4-5 pin its voices to core 0 or 1 (or
  either, whichever has more free voices), bits 0-3 are its dry left/right and
  effect-send left/right switches, so only those samples feed the core's reverb.
- **Volume**: a voice sounds at velocity (through the curve) x program x split
  x sample volume, each a fraction of 128, x channel volume x expression, each
  a fraction of 128, x port volume / 256 (`ezMidi(0xB0 + port)`, so the SE
  ports' 256 is unity and a sequence plays at its `sqtbl.txt` volume over 256).
  The pan law keeps the near side at full scale and fades the far side to
  silence 63 steps from the centre.
- **Pitch**: 4096 x rate / 48000 x 2^((note + transposes - base note + fine / 128
  + bend x range / 8192 / 128) / 12), at most 0x3FFF, as the SPU2 pitch register.

`DC_AUDIO_TRACE=1` prints every `CSound` call (bank and sequence loads with
their names, `SQ_Play` with its table volume, `SetVol`, `SE_Play`, fades,
reverb), every `ezMidi` command, every channel message a sequence sends with
its output time, every key-on's resolved sample, pitch, gain and core, and the
sequencer's tempo and loop events. `DC_AUDIO_WAV=<path>` opens no device and
instead pulls the mixer on the game thread as the clock ticks, writing 16-bit
stereo at 48 kHz: N ticks write N/50 s whatever the run's real speed, so
`DC_AUDIO_WAV=title.wav darkcloud --headless --jump title --fast-load --frames
600` records what the title would have played. `audio_real_title_*` render the
title pack's music on the real data (`DC_DATA`); with `DC_AUDIO_TEST_WAV=<dir>`
they also write what they rendered there.

What still differs from the PS2: the reverb is a generic room, not the SPU2's
effect programs and work area; core 0's output does not pass through core 1;
the ADSR runs at the SPU's rate but key follow of the envelope, LFOs, velocity
crossfades and per-key pan follow are not applied; effect messages resolve
their tone by key range, then split index.

## Saves and host files

The port has no memory card. Its saves are in `<save>/saves/`, a folder for
each save named after the number its board shows, from 1, with no 12-save
cap (up to nine digits):

```
<save>/saves/
    1/save.dat
    2/save.dat
    state.json
```

`save.dat` is retail's 0x136A7-byte image unchanged: `CSaveData` (0x131C0
bytes), the version string (`darkcloudVer1.9`) in 0x20 bytes, and a checksum
byte for every 64 bytes of save data, the bytes the game wrote to the card
as `darkcloudN`, so a save copied out of a card export loads as it is. Board
(and folder) N is the game's file N - 1. A folder holds what belongs to its
save, so more files can join `save.dat` later.

`state.json` is what the title needs before a save is loaded, which the
card's configuration file held on the PS2: `last_save`, the folder of the
last save loaded or written, where the save and load screens start (New
Game keeps it whole, where retail's configuration copy keeps one byte), and
`game_clear`, the clear flag from the current game (config word 14),
which the title reads. It sits with the saves rather than in `config.json`
because it is game progress and screen state, not a setting, and it is
written with the saves. It contains only these two keys; `last_save` is 0
when there is no remembered slot. `state.json` contains no options, and
`save.dat` retains retail's image layout. Without `state.json`, or with one
that is not a JSON object, the game keeps its own values. Unknown keys,
invalid types and slot numbers outside 0..999999999 are ignored. Files
larger than 64 KiB are rejected. A successful load remembers its slot without
changing the persisted clear flag, falling back to the session's pre-load
flag when state cannot supply one. If that state write fails, it reports the
failure to stderr and still loads the valid save. Saving and the ending's
state write explicitly record the current game's clear flag.

`port/src/memorycardaccess.cpp` replaces the operations of
`CMemoryCardAccess` with plain reads and writes of these files
(`port/src/save_slots.cpp` names and lists them, `port/src/platform/save_state.cpp`
reads and writes `state.json`); each finishes in the step that starts it. Every write goes through `FilesWrite`
(`port/src/platform/files.cpp`): a temporary file of its own beside the
target, `<target>.<16 hex digits>.tmp`, created exclusively, written,
flushed to the disk and closed, then moved onto the target. Until that move
the target keeps what it held. Removing the temporary file after a failure
is best effort: one left by a game that died during a write, or by a
removal that failed, is ignored by the game and can be deleted by hand.

- Windows flushes with `FlushFileBuffers` and moves with `MoveFileExW` and
  write-through.
- POSIX flushes with `fsync`; macOS, whose `fsync` stops at the drive's
  cache, uses `F_FULLFSYNC`, and falls back to `fsync` only on a file
  system that does not offer it (`ENOTSUP`, `EINVAL`, `ENOTTY` and the
  like); any other error fails the write. The move is `rename`, or for a new
  save an exclusive rename (`renameat2` with `RENAME_NOREPLACE` on Linux,
  `renamex_np` with `RENAME_EXCL` on macOS), then a sync of the directory. A
  file system without the exclusive rename gets a hard link and the
  temporary name's removal instead; one with neither cannot take a new save.

Saving over a save replaces its `save.dat`. A new save takes its folder by
creating it (a unique temporary directory published with
`MoveFileExW(MOVEFILE_WRITE_THROUGH)` on Windows, or `mkdir` followed by a
sync of `saves/` on POSIX),
which fails when anything has that name, then writes `save.dat` into it
without replacing; when its number has been taken since the list was read,
by a second copy of the game or a folder copied in by hand, it goes to the
next free number. A failed new save leaves its claimed numbered folder
reserved, even when empty: the pathname could have been replaced by another
actor since creation. A retry uses the next free number. Creating `saves/`
also syncs its new name. Temporary
directories use the same ignored `.tmp` suffix as temporary files. Only regular-file
handles are read; other entries are skipped without reading their contents.
The card the save screens still check is always there, formatted and with room,
and so is its save directory; format, unformat, the write test and the
conversion of NTSC 1.0 saves do nothing.

The save screens (`port/src/memcard.cpp`, `port/src/menu_save.cpp`) keep
retail's steps, less the card:

- The card choice is gone: the screen opens on its list.
- The boards are every readable save in file order, then, on the save
  screen only, one "New file" board, which saves to the lowest free N. File
  order keeps each board where it was from one visit to the next and matches
  the number on it. Saving over a save asks first, as retail did; a new save
  does not. With no saves the load screen shows no board, Cross is refused
  and Circle goes back.
- The chosen board sits where retail's did and the rest scroll past above
  and below it. Up and down move one board (held, they repeat), L1 and R1
  jump to the first and the last; Circle closes the screen.
- The cursor starts on the last save used (config word 17, which a load and
  a save set, and which follows a new save that moved on); when that file has
  no board, on the New file board, or on the load screen the first save.
- No message names the card. Checks and transfers finish within a frame and
  show none; the save after the ending asks "Want to save?" (message 260 of
  `allmenu.mes`) where retail asked to save the cleared data to the card
  (298), and Cross after it closes the screen where retail went back to the
  card choice; an alert only a card raised reads "Saving failed." (266) or
  "Loading failed." (274).
- The save after the ending writes `state.json` in its step. When that
  fails, "Saving failed." shows; Cross asks again and Circle closes the
  screen. Retail waited on the write for ever.
- A save is listed only when its folder's name is a number from 1 with no
  leading zero (`01` is not save 1) and its `save.dat` is at least a save
  long, of this version and with every checksum right. Anything else under
  such a name, a save of another version, a damaged one, a folder without a
  save or a file in a folder's place, is left alone and keeps its number from
  a new save. Retail deleted a save of another version once its message (299)
  was dismissed.
- A board names the save's map from a table of 62; a map number outside it
  shows as the first.

Saves in the card layout earlier builds wrote, or in a card export, are not
moved by the game. By hand, from `<save>/mc0/BESCES-50295dkcloud/` (or the
same folder of a card export):

| File | Goes to |
|---|---|
| `darkcloudN` | `<save>/saves/<N + 1>/save.dat`: `darkcloud0` to `saves/1/save.dat` |
| `BESCES-50295dkcloud`, the configuration | not used; the next save writes `state.json` |
| `icon.sys`, `dkicon.ico`, `dkicon_c.ico`, `dkicon_d.ico` | not used |

The flat `<save>/darkcloudN` and `<save>/sysconfig.bin` of earlier builds of
this layout are not read either: `darkcloudN` moves to `saves/<N + 1>/save.dat`
the same way.

For example, to copy File 1 from an export on Windows, choose a free board
number, create its folder and copy just the save payload, without replacing
anything already there:

```powershell
$slot = '<save>/saves/1'
if (Test-Path -LiteralPath $slot) { throw 'Choose an unused slot number' }
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $slot -ErrorAction Stop
[IO.File]::Copy('<export>/BESCES-50295dkcloud/darkcloud0', "$slot/save.dat", $false)
```

The folder number may differ from the exported file number. Keep the
original export; no icons or configuration file need to accompany the copy.

`sce/libmc.cpp` still implements libmc on `<save>/mc0/` and `<save>/mc1/`, a
directory per card, every command finishing inside the call that issues it
and the next `sceMcSync` reporting the function number and result. The game
reaches none of it but `MemCheckInit`'s `sceMcInit`, in the boot card check
the port skips; `tests/platform_mc_test.cpp` covers it. `sce/sifdev.cpp` implements `sceOpen`,
`sceRead`, `sceWrite`, `sceLseek` and `sceClose` on `<save>/host0/` with the
device prefix stripped (the debug dump `edit.cpp` writes to `host0:`), and
`WriteFile` writes there too.

## Game text

`port/src/gametext.cpp` writes the port's own text in the game's message
font, so menus the port adds can match the game's. A message is an s16 code
per character ending in `MES_CODE_END` (-0xFF); a space is
`MES_CODE_SPACE` (-0xFE) and a line break `MES_CODE_NEWLINE` (-0x100). The
PAL font draws only the external characters from -0x300: -0x300 to -0x2E0
are the pad buttons and icons; -0x2DF to -0x288 are the 88 cells of
`gaiji.img`'s letter grid in order (`A`-`Z`, `a`-`z`,
`'="!?#&+-*/%()@|<>{}[]:,.$` and `0`-`9`); -0x287 to -0x254 are `œ ¡ ¿ ß Œ
Ç ç` and the letters `DrawGaijiFont` draws an accent over (`ÀÁÂÄÈÉÊËÌÍÎÏÑ
ÒÓÔÖÙÚÛÜàáâäèéêëìíîïñòóôöùúûü`). -0x263 to -0x261, -0x253 and -0x252
draw a bare `?`. There is no `;`, `_`, `~`, `^`, backquote or backslash.
The table was read off the `gaiji.img` of every `meswin/mes_tex_N.pak` (all
seven draw these characters in the same cells; only the pixels differ) and
checked by decoding every `.mes` on the disc: each language uses only
characters in it, and its own accents only.

`GameTextEncode` turns UTF-8 into codes. Curly quotes and dashes become the
font's own; any other character the font lacks, and any byte that is not
UTF-8, becomes `?` and is counted. `{N}` writes code N as it is, for control
codes and icons, and `{{` a `{`; `GameTextDecode` writes the same form, so
any message reads back and encodes to the same codes. `GameTextFile` lays
texts out as a message file for `ClsMes::SetBuff`. `GameText` is one piece of
text drawn as the menus draw their help line (`InitMenuMesSet`'s
`CommonMenuMes2`: the menu font, white with a black edge, shown whole): `Set`
the text, `SetColour` a `FontColor`, then `Draw(x, y, alpha)` from a menu's
draw function; `Width` gives its width for aligning a value.

Both have retail's fixed sizes. A window lays out at most `MES_WIN_LINE_MAX`
(720) characters, counting the end and what a `{N}` name, value or system
message code expands to; retail's `SetMesWinTbl` writes on past the table, so
the port's (`port/src/clsmes.cpp`) takes no more, and `GameText::Set` gives back
-1, draws nothing and has a width of 0 for a text that did not fit. A line past
the window's ten `line_pos` entries draws in the block layout, as a line
without one does. A message file is s16 throughout: an id is -0x8000 to
0x7FFF. Every message must start within 0x7FFF codes of `&buff[1 + count]`;
the last message by id may extend beyond that range. `GameTextFile::Set`
gives back -1 and leaves the file as it was where either would not hold.

## The Options screen

The game's Options screen, from the title, the town menu and the dungeon menu,
is the port's settings screen (`port/src/menu_option.cpp`, which replaces
`InitMenuOption`, `MenuOptionKey`, `DrawMenuOption` and
`OptionMenuFadeOutStart`). It keeps the game's frame, cursor, sounds, EXIT
button and help window, and draws its rows in the game's message font ("Game
text"). Four pages, Game, Display, Audio and Controls, are named on a help
window's plate with L1 and R1 at its ends; L1 and L2, R1 and R2 turn the page,
and so do left and right on the page names. Each row is a label and a value:
left and right change the value at once, cross goes round its choices, and a
value whose setting `ConfigAppliesOnRestart` names ends in ` *`. Every change
goes through `ConfigChange`, so it applies at once and rewrites `config.json`.
On EXIT, cross closes. From anywhere, square puts the page's defaults back,
triangle undoes every change since the screen opened, and circle closes. The
three shortcuts stay visible below EXIT. If saving fails, the help window
says the changes apply now but could not be saved; another change or closing
retries the write. The game's own options keep their help from `allmenu.mes`;
the port's rows have English
help. Retail's screen-position row is gone: `MGAdjustScreen` moves nothing on PC.

| Page | Rows |
|---|---|
| Game | save cursor position, message speed, clock, time speed, dungeon map, enemy damage, party damage, enemy HP, names |
| Display | window mode, resolution (the monitor's own and the sizes that fit it), V-Sync (`fifo`, `mailbox`, `immediate`), frame limit, aspect ratio, interface size (`ui_scale`), smooth motion (`interpolation`), FPS counter, soft focus |
| Audio | volume, sound (stereo or mono) |
| Controls | vibration, mouse sensitivity (in hundredths below 1 and tenths above, whatever its unit), invert mouse Y, stick sensitivity |

Resolution choices are the sizes that fit the display (its usable area less
the window's borders when windowed) and follow changes of mode. Desktop is
fullscreen at the monitor's size, so Window Mode reads Fullscreen there;
choosing Windowed from it gives the largest listed size that fits. In
fullscreen an explicit resolution is kept for the window. Headless runs keep
the standard size list.

The display fields reach the window through the host's change hook
(`DisplayChanged`, `platform/display`, which also applies `--width` and
`--height`). SDL may refuse a change of mode or finish it late, so the window
is read back: where it is not in the mode asked for, the display fields, in
`config.json` too, become the mode it is in, and the help window says so
until a later display change takes. While that stands, or while a fullscreen
change SDL took is unfinished, the host's pump (`DisplayPump`) follows the
window, open or closed; otherwise a window resized by hand changes no
setting. A fullscreen change that finishes after SDL's timeout is not
cancelled by choosing the mode still shown or by Undo; the settings follow it
when it finishes. If reading the window back fails while following, the
fields wait for the next fullscreen or resize event.

Interface size (`ui_scale`) scales the HUD and the game's menus. The
Options screen itself stays at 100% while it is open (`MenuOptionOpen`, read
by `main.cpp`'s frame layout), so no size can take its tabs, EXIT or
shortcuts off the window; the new size shows once it closes.

The screen times its own auto-repeat from the pad as held (`InputGetPad`, the
left stick read as `MenuModeOn(120)` reads it): a direction fires when pressed,
then after 30 frames every 5, retail's menu rate, whichever menu opened it.

While the screen is open the mouse is its pointer (`InputSetMenuMouse`): its
motion and buttons stop pressing pad 1's buttons and turning its stick and
reach `InputTakeMenuMouse` instead. Capture works as everywhere else, so the
pointer is the game's own hand, moved by the mouse's relative motion; a
released cursor (Escape in a window) is taken back by a click as ever. That
keeps one pointer whether the window is windowed, fullscreen or headless, and
maps relative motion through the window's logical scale to the
2D screen. The hand appears when the mouse moves and goes when a key moves the
cursor. Hovering a row, a page name or EXIT selects it, and hovering L1, R1
or a scroll arrow puts the brackets round it; a click on a page name
or on L1 or R1 turns the page, on a value's `<` or `>` steps it, on the value
goes round its choices, and on EXIT closes; the right button closes; the
wheel scrolls a long list under the pointer, and the chosen row moves with
the list as it scrolls. Mouse buttons already held when the screen opens act
only once let go and pressed again. Eight rows fit at once; a scroll
bar at the right appears on cursor movement and fades after 75 idle ticks
(the last 15 ticks fade). The arrow buttons at its ends scroll too. A script's
`mouse:DX,DY` and `mouseN` drive the pointer as they would the mouse.

The game's own options are global, not per save. Retail keeps them in each
save (`CSaveData::config`, the dungeon status's `minimap_status` and the menu
cursors' `reset_pos`), so loading a save brought its own. Here `config.json`
holds them, and `GameOptionsApply` puts them in the running save before every
mode starts (`RunGame`, before `ModeInit`), after a new game, and whenever they
change. `CMemoryCardAccess::SetBuff` zeroes them in the copy it writes, so
`save.dat` carries no options; its layout is retail's, so their bytes remain,
as zeros.

## Arenas

`CDataAlloc2<1>::Alloc/Alloc64/Align64` and the carving in
`InitializeDataBuffer`, `BufferAllClear`, `SetDataBuffer` and
`SetPacketReadBuffer` (`dataset.cpp`, `dataalloc2_1.cpp`) give each arena its
own block, an ordinary anonymous mapping wherever the system puts it
(`port/src/platform/memory.hpp`), sized at four times the quadwords retail
asked for (`kArenaHeadroom`, `port/src/arena.hpp`), because the game sizes
allocations with the host's larger `sizeof`s. A guard page follows each
block, and an overflow aborts naming the arena instead of retail's endless
loop. A debug build stops when no block lies above 4 GiB, so a mapping that
drifted low cannot hide a pointer the game truncates (below).

Retail places objects in runs whose quadword counts it wrote by hand
(`new ((u_long128 *) alloc->Alloc(4)) CCollisionMDT`), and the host's object is
larger wherever it holds a pointer or a vtable: the collision is five
quadwords, the cloth, its bounds, the fish and the visuals outgrow theirs too.
The placement operators (`dataalloc2_1.cpp`) therefore grow the run they are
handed to the object's size while it is still the arena's last, so nothing
allocated afterwards lies under the object's tail. At retail's four quadwords
the collision's `mesh_count` landed on the x of the first triangle built
behind it, which opened holes in dungeon floors. An allocation that is cast
rather than placed has no size to go by and is sized in `port/src` instead
(`Quadwords<T>` in `editloop_init.cpp`).

## Pointers and 32-bit integers

The game was written for a 32-bit ABI and casts pointers to `int` and back.
`darkcloud` is position-independent (`-pie -z separate-code`) and its arenas
lie above 4 GiB, as on arm64 macOS, whose low 4 GiB are a hard page zero, so
such a round trip faults where it happens instead of working by luck.
`scripts/port/truncations.py` finds every cast of a pointer to a narrower
integer with libclang, follows the value to where it becomes a pointer
again, and says whether the function holding it runs in the linked
executable; `docs/port/truncations.md` is its output. CI runs it with
`--check`, which fails while the file is stale or lists a round trip that
can run.

Each retail function holding such a round trip is replaced by a copy of its
body with the cast widened (a `uintptr_t` for an address formed from an
integer, the pointer itself where retail kept it in an `int`) and nothing
else changed:

| Function | Unit | Change |
|---|---|---|
| `DunMoveChara`, `BtCheckDamageProc` | `dun/movechara.cpp` | addresses of `NowDngMap`'s parts and of the active item counters on a `uintptr_t` |
| `CDungeonMap::BuildCharaSpecialParts`, `SetCharaDoor` | `dungeonmap.cpp` | the key door's cell on a `uintptr_t` |
| `BtGetTreasureboxBig_Init`/`_Loop`, `BtGetTreasureboxSmall_Init`/`_Loop`, `BtGetGateKey_Init`/`_Loop`, `BtEscape_Init`/`_Loop` | `btitem.cpp` | the files read between the two halves kept as pointers, not in `itemOpenItemMds`, `itemOpenItemImg` and `escape_chr` |
| `_ITEM_USE_WINDOW`, `BtMiniItemSelect_Loop` | `btsysscript.cpp`, `btitem.cpp` | the script slot the choice goes to kept as a pointer (`btitem_port.hpp`) and written through the host's `RS_STACKDATA`, whose value is at byte 8 |
| `BtSystemScriptLoad`, `BtSystemScriptRun` | `btsysscript.cpp` | the event script kept as a pointer, not in `BtEventData` |
| `EditInit`, `InitWorkBuffer` | `editloop_init.cpp` | arena starts rounded on the whole pointer |
| `CommandWATER_SHAKE` | `editmapscript.cpp` | the wave slot on a `uintptr_t` |
| `CEditGround::DrawPartsCursor` | `editground.cpp` | the preview frame `LoadObjectParts` keeps in an `s32` matched against the part's own frames |
| `FishingExchangeKey` | `shop.cpp` | the attachment slots on a `uintptr_t` |
| `EnterWeaponModel`, `WeaponModelBuildFunc`, `DngWeaponEquipModelBuild` | `menu_misc.cpp` | the weapons' files in a table of pointers; retail's `int` table read back as `u_int *` at a 4-byte stride |

Records read from the disc with pointer-sized fields are decoded into host
records rather than used in place: `.pts` part definitions
(`eparts_port.cpp`, for `LoadPTS` in `editloop_parts.cpp` and `GetFuncPoint`
in `edit_in_parts.cpp`; `EdInitToEPInfo`, `editloop3.cpp`, lays its own out
past the host header) and the event scripts' function records and stacks
(`runscript.cpp`). The wind a title scene stores in `CCharacter::wind`, an
`int`, is recovered by `CCharacter::ClothStep` with `PortImagePointer`, which
widens it against the image's own address.

## What is still a stub

`port/src/stubs/sce/` holds the remaining SDK stubs: libdma, libgraph (all but
`sceGsSyncV`, which is `port/src/sce/libgraph.cpp`) and libpkt. Each calls
`PS2_UNIMPLEMENTED()` (`port/include/port.h`), which prints the function,
file and line and aborts. They stay stubs by design: the port does not
emulate DMA chains, VIF/GIF packets or the GS, so a call that reaches one
is a drawing path no replacement unit covers yet.

Everything else from the SDK is implemented in `port/src/sce/`: libvu0 in
C++ (static constructors call it before `main`), libpad, libmc, sifdev,
eekernel (`FlushCache` and friends do nothing, `Exit` exits), libcdvd's
`sceCdInit`/`sceCdMmode` and sifrpc's IOP boot and module loads (no-ops).
The Metrowerks runtime calls are in `port/src/runtime.cpp`: `mwInit` does
nothing; `LoadOverlay` reconstructs selected title objects when switching to
the title overlay; `mwLoadOverlay` succeeds, `__assert` prints and exits with
status 4, `exit__2` exits. The same file replaces the stand-ins in `ps2/src`
for what the PS2 runtime generated that use names only the PS2 link defines:
four constructors and `__unexpected` become functions that call
`PS2_UNIMPLEMENTED()`, and `std::exception`'s virtual table and the overlay
address table become empty tables. Nothing in the port reaches them, but a
COFF link wants every name an object uses defined.

None of the 44 aborting stub functions is linked into `darkcloud`, and neither is
`Ps2Unimplemented` itself: `--gc-sections` keeps only what `main` reaches,
and no function it reaches calls a stub. To check after a change,
disassemble `port/build/pc/darkcloud` (`llvm-objdump -d`), collect the functions
with a `call` to a stub's address and map them to their source with
`llvm-addr2line`; static helpers inlined into a caller show under that
caller.

At the last count `port/src` tagged 330 definitions `PC_OVERRIDE`, each
replacing one of `ps2/src`'s, and the final link held 4,145 of the game's own
(`llvm-nm` of the `dc_ps2` objects' external definitions against the
executable's symbols).

## Known gaps

- **Rendering approximations.** DATE/DATM (destination alpha test,
  `MakeFukidashi`'s mask) is not emulated. TEX1 LOD (L, K) is ignored in
  favour of standard trilinear filtering. The GS blends that need a factor
  above 1 or a destination scaled past 1 are approximated
  (`port/src/gfx/README.md`, "Blending" and "Not done here").
- **Overlay re-initialisation.** Retail reloads `TITLE.BIN` or `DUN.BIN` and
  re-runs its constructors on every switch; the port links both once and
  runs nothing again but the title objects it lays out with host classes
  (below). Other globals a mode expects fresh keep the previous visit's
  values.
- **Arena headroom** is four times retail's request across the board, a
  stopgap rather than measured peaks.
- **Retail statics of the title units.** The title units' own static
  constructors still build their file-local `CFireOmni`, `CMapObject`,
  `CEffectGroup` and `OBJ_ANIME_SEQ` objects at PS2 sizes with the host
  constructors, which write up to 16 bytes past each. Every such object is
  dead in the port (its users are the port's copies, with their own
  statics), and what the writes reach is another dead title static or
  padding, but the bytes are written.

## How far the game runs

With the PAL data extracted and no input, `darkcloud --headless --frames 120`
boots, compiles the pipelines, runs the 60-tick warm-up and the loading
screen, draws the language select (English highlighted) and exits 0 with
that frame in the screenshot. Scripted (above), it plays the attract movie,
the title screen and its menu, and START opens the opening book. Through the
developer menu, the opening's scenes play, the dungeon loader lists the
seven dungeons, floor 1 of the first starts through its name card and Toan
walks it until the Mayor's event script takes over, and the town `e01`
(Norune) loads its parts and is walked. No stub is reached on the way.

## The title overlay's own class declarations

The title units (`ps2/src/title/*.cpp`) declare other units' classes
themselves, with only the members they touch named and the PS2 extents
padded out, and the PS2 link binds them to the main executable's code. On
the host the main executable's code uses the real classes, with 8-byte
pointers:

| Class | Title units' size | Host size | Declared by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `OBJ_ANIME_SEQ` | 144 | 192 | op_a, op_b, op_c, opening, rushmovi, title |
| `CMap` | 2800 | 3120 | op_a, opening, rushmovi, title, titleloop |
| `CMapObject` | 240 (op_a), 256 | 272 | all but sprite |
| `CObjectFrame` | 176 | 224 | op_b, op_c, op_d, opening, rushmovi, title, titleloop |
| `CWater` | 816 | 848 | op_c, rushmovi, title, titleloop |
| `CFireOmni` | 64 | 80 | op_a, op_b, op_c, rushmovi, title, titleloop |
| `CEffectParam` | 240 | 256 | op_a, op_c |
| `CEffectGroup` | 8 | 16 | op_a, op_c |
| `CategoryAttr` (`CMapCategoryAttr`) | 24 | 24 | op_a, opening |
| `CRunEffect` | 208 | 208 | rushmovi, title, titleloop |
| `CRect<int>` (`CRect_i_`), `RECT` | 16 | 16 | all |
| `SND_INFO` (op_c's own table row, unrelated to `snd.hpp`'s) | 24 | 16 | op_c |

The port defines every shared object of a mismatched class with the real
one: op_a's `OP_GroundMap`, `OP_BuildingMap`, `OP_BuildingMap2`,
`OP_AnimeSeq[32]` and `CFire`, op_b's `OP_NornMapObj[76]` and
`OP_NornMapObj2[87]`, op_c's `Water`, rushmovi's `Water__2` and `CFire__4`.
Every function that indexes or sizes them is the port's, compiled against
the real headers: the long-tail copies of op_a, op_b, op_c, opening and
rushmovi, `port/src/title/title.cpp` (all of title.cpp's scene set-ups and
draws), `opening_mds.cpp` (`OPAnalyz`, `OPMdsLoad` and the definition
reader's state) and op_d's `OpD_InitProcess`, `OpD_InitProcess2` and
`OpD_DrawProcess`, which reach op_d's statics through names its stub header
gives them. The smoke pools are sized from the host `CEffect` (288 bytes,
where retail asked for fifty 256-byte ones).

The port's definitions of those objects are tagged `PC_OVERRIDE`, so the
title units' own are left out and only the port's constructors run over them
at start-up, never the title units' at the PS2 strides. `LoadOverlay`
(`port/src/runtime.cpp`) does what retail's overlay loader did when a mode
needs TITLE.BIN and DUN.BIN (or nothing) was loaded before:
`TitleOverlayConstruct` zeroes those objects and constructs them again (and
initialises the maps, as op_a's constructor did).

## Layout

The root `CMakeLists.txt` only picks the platform:

- `ps2/src` is the game's code, exactly as the PS2 build compiles it, and
  nothing else. Port accommodations never live in `ps2/src` or `ps2/include`;
  the one exception is the `#ifndef PORT` around functions written in
  assembly (below).
  `ps2/CMakeLists.txt` (with `ps2/cmake/`) is the PS2 build.
- `port/src` is code only the port compiles. `port/CMakeLists.txt` is the
  port's build. `main.cpp` and `gameloop.cpp` start the game;
  `platform/`, `gfx/` and `audio/` are the host side; `sce/` implements the
  SDK; `stubs/sce/` holds the stubs left; `<unit>.cpp` (and `dun/`) replace
  functions of `ps2/src/<unit>.cpp`, sometimes split as `<unit>_math.cpp`,
  `<unit>_draw.cpp` or `<unit>_port.cpp`; `linknames.cpp` supplies link-time
  names (below); `tests/` is `darkcloud_tests`, GoogleTest cases that ctest
  runs one process each.
- `tools/dcdata` is the data extraction tool.
- `ps2/include` holds the game's headers and, under `ps2/include/sce` and
  `ps2/include/std`, the SDK and standard headers MWCC compiles against. Both
  builds use them.
- `port/include` holds headers only the port uses: `port.h`, included ahead
  of every unit it compiles, and `stubs/` (below).

## How `port/src` takes precedence

`port/src` tags every definition that replaces one of `ps2/src`'s with
`PC_OVERRIDE`, which `port/include/port.h` defines as nothing:

```cpp
PC_OVERRIDE void MGClearScreen(u_char r) {
```

`ps2/src` carries no mark of it. `port/CMakeLists.txt` builds the two halves
like this, on every platform:

1. `scripts/port/pc_override.py list` reads the tags in `port/src` and writes
   the name each tagged definition links under to
   `port/build/pc/pc_overrides.txt`: a function's qualified name and
   parameter types, or the name alone for a variable and for a function with
   C linkage.
2. `pc_override.py strip` writes a copy of every unit in `ps2/src` under
   `port/build/pc/ps2_src` without its definitions of those names. A function
   becomes its declaration, a member function is removed (its class declares
   it; an explicit specialization keeps its declaration) and a variable
   becomes an `extern` declaration. Lines keep their numbers and a `#line`
   directive names the original, so diagnostics and debug information point
   into `ps2/src`.
3. `pc_override.py check` stops the build if a listed name is defined by no
   unit of `ps2/src`.
4. The copies are compiled, with `PORT` defined.
5. The units in `port/src` are compiled and linked with them.

Each name then has one definition. A replacement without a tag leaves the
`ps2/src` definition in, and the link fails on the duplicate symbol, unless
that definition is `inline` or Apple's linker drops it as dead code first. A tag
whose signature `ps2/src` does not have fails the check: the two would be
different symbols, both would link, and the game would go on calling
`ps2/src`'s.

To replace a function, define it in `port/src` with `PC_OVERRIDE` in front and
the signature `ps2/src` gives it: the parameter types are compared as they are
spelled, names and default arguments aside. By convention it goes in the file
that mirrors its unit: `port/src/mglib.cpp` holds the replacements for
`ps2/src/mglib.cpp`. A name the unit's stub header renames (below) is tagged
under its new name. What is replaced has to be a function with its body or a
variable without constructor arguments (a pointer to a function, or an array
of them, by the name inside its declarator), at file scope of a unit, with no
preprocessor directive before its body, and an `#if` block in its body has to
lie wholly inside it with every branch leaving the same braces open. It has to
be one the port compiles: under `#ifdef` or `#ifndef` of `PORT` or `PAL`, in
the branch the port takes; under any other condition, in every branch. The
script stops the build on a definition it cannot take out whole, on an
`inline` one it cannot read, which the link would not catch, and on a unit
with a line continued by a backslash outside a preprocessor directive. A
`static` function cannot be replaced this way; it keeps the body `ps2/src`
gives it. Nor can one defined in a class body, a namespace or a header: the
check finds nothing to replace. A variable takes one name per declaration,
and its declaration has no comma outside `()`, `[]` and `{}`: angle brackets do not
count, so a template type with a comma (`std::pair<int, int>`, or
`make<int, int>()` in its initialiser) needs a `using` alias, and the script
stops on one rather than guess. A replaced definition has to spell out its own
boundaries: a macro that expands to a comma or a semicolon in it is not
supported, and the script does not notice one.


## Per-unit adjustments

`port/include/stubs/<unit>.hpp`, if it exists, is included ahead of
`ps2/src/<unit>.cpp`, after `port.h`, and nothing else. Only the port's build
sees `port/include`; the PS2 build compiles nothing differently. It declares
what the port defines in place of code `PORT` leaves out, and supplies or
renames what the unit takes from MWCC or from the PS2 link alone:

- `bound`, `cloth`, `collisionmdt`, `frame`, `gameutil`, `mglib`, `visualvu1`
  and `water` get declarations of their `static` assembly functions, which
  the port defines.
- `battlemenu` and `editground` pass each temporary `CRect_i_` as an lvalue
  (`Ps2Lvalue`, `port/include/port.h`): MWCC binds a temporary to the non-const
  references of `DrawMenuColorGradation` and `CEditGround::CheckPartsRect`.
- `editloop3` gives its static `EdSetVillagerNextPos` a global forwarder,
  `PortEdSetVillagerNextPos`, for the port's `EdMoveVillager`, and declares
  its static `EdEventScript` `extern` first, for the port's `EdRunEvent`
  (`port/src/runscript.cpp`): retail's has no return statement and leaves
  `CRunScript::run`'s result in `v0` for `EdEventInit`. Walking villagers in
  Muska Racka use its fixed ground model's collision, so their feet follow
  the sculpted terrain instead of the editable grid's flat polygons.
- `main` gets an overload of `LoadFileMenuData` for a `const char *`: one call
  names its file with a comma expression ending in a string literal.
- `mathutil` gets the Metrowerks runtime's own `std::exception` and
  `std::bad_exception` renamed apart from the host library's, and
  `__exception_magic`, which MWCC provides inside an exception handler.
- `menu_save` and `memcard` export statics the other calls: memcard's
  `SaveMenuFunc` table names menu_save's eighteen `SaveMenuKey*` steps and
  menu_save calls memcard's `ExitSaveSelect`. The port's `SaveMenuFunc`
  (`port/src/memcard.cpp`) names six of memcard's own steps as well. Each
  header defines a global forwarder under the external name (an asm label),
  which also keeps clang from dropping the unused static.
- `title/rushmovi` declares title.cpp's `DataLoad`, `DrawProcA`..`I` and
  `DrawProcTitle` static; its header defines those statics as forwarders to
  the global ones.
- `mapparts` has its `CMapParts::DrawLOD` replaced (`port/src/mapparts.cpp`):
  retail lifts a part off the ground by its own distance from the eye, which
  leaves neighbouring road tiles at different heights and the ground showing
  through the step between them at any resolution above the PS2's; the port
  lifts other parts by the height retail gives one 100 units away and roads by
  a shared 0.5-unit height so the uneven ground cannot intermittently cover
  their surface as the camera follows the player.
- `title/op_d` declares the state and the helpers `OpD_InitProcess`,
  `OpD_InitProcess2` and `OpD_DrawProcess` share with the rest of the unit
  `extern` under `OpD_*` names before the unit declares them `static`, and
  gives the static helpers global forwarders, so the port's copies of those
  three reach them.
- The per-object renames below.

## Names the PS2 build renames

`main.cpp` calls other units through the names MWCC gives them
(`init_all__Fv`) and calls the overlays' entry points through their retail
addresses (`func_01DAC1C0`). `port/src/main.cpp` forwards each one to the real
function.

The PS2 link binds some names through `ps2/config/pal/object_fixups.json` and the
linker script rather than through the source. The port reproduces each:

- **Per-object renames**, by `#define` in the unit's header: the opening
  scenes' four `FaceChange(int)` become op_b's `FaceChange`, op_c's
  `FaceChangeC`, op_d's `FaceChangeD` and rushmovi's `FaceChangeMovie`, the
  names their neighbours call them by; the dungeon's `MainDraw` and
  `MoveChara` become `DunMainDraw` and `DunMoveChara`, apart from editloop's
  (`port/src/dun/gameloop.cpp` replaces `DunMainDraw`); edit_in's `Chara`,
  `MainCamera`, `NowCamera`, `TalkCamera`, `NowTime`, `TexAnimeData`,
  `camera_dist_mode`, `door_open_cnt`, `fix_chara_pos`, `fix_chara_rot`,
  `goto_menu`, `goto_return_menu`, `key_counter` and `loop_counter`, which it
  redeclares `static` after a header declares them `extern` (MWCC makes them
  file-local, clang's `-fms-extensions` keeps them global), become
  `EditIn_*`.
- **Pooled literals under extern names** (`BtAtraShortCharaFile`,
  `MdsExtension`, `gamemode_empty_string`, `allmenu_mes` and six more) and
  **the title overlay's own `CRect<int>`** spelling of the rectangle in
  `MGFillBox`, `MGMoveImage`, `MGStretchMoveImage`, `MoveImageTest` and the
  `set2DSprite` overloads, plus op_c's `CWater::DrawVu1` and main's
  `MAP_NPC_MODEL::operator=`: weak definitions and forwarders in
  `port/src/linknames.cpp`.
- **Aliases**, by `--defsym` (ld64's `-alias` on macOS) in
  `port/CMakeLists.txt`: `draw_rect` = `draw_rect_store` and
  `WorkBuffer__2` = `WorkBuffer`. `ItemPutListTbl12_bytes` is not an alias:
  `port/include/stubs/dngstatusdata.hpp` turns `GetItem`'s folded PS2 byte
  index into a typed `WeaponList` owner lookup.
  `EditGaijiTbl` is `GaijiDataTbl + 0x601C` on the PS2 link. The linker
  script places it inside `EditPartsData`, but the codes `clsmes.cpp`
  indexes it with (-0x300 and up) only ever land on the last word of a
  `GaijiDataTbl` entry, and `GaijiDataTbl` keeps its layout on the host
  where `EditPartsData`'s pointers grow. ld64 cannot alias with an offset,
  so `linknames.cpp` defines it on every platform: storage for the 0x300
  entries below it, filled from `GaijiDataTbl` before `main`, with
  `EditGaijiTbl` an assembler alias of the storage's end.

Data the title overlay's units type themselves with PS2 layouts: see "The
title overlay's own class declarations".

## Game headers

`port/include/port.h` adjusts two game headers for the host, from outside:

- `types.h` defines the PS2's `size_t` and `NULL`. `port.h` includes it with
  `size_t` renamed and `NULL` saved, so the host's stay in force, and
  `#pragma once` keeps the game from including it again.
- `common.h` defines `STATIC_ASSERT`, which checks the PS2's layouts. `port.h`
  includes it and redefines the macro to check nothing.


## Keeping the PS2 build matching

Edits to `ps2/src` or `ps2/include` that help clang must leave both PS2 builds
byte-identical. They are corrections that are standard C++ either way, never
code for the port:

- **Initialisations a `switch` jumps over.** They are split into a declaration
  and an assignment.
- **Language linkage.** `BtEnemyLayoutList` and `BtUraEnemyLayoutList` are
  declared `extern "C"` to match their definitions.
- **Exception specifications.** `__dl` is declared `throw()`, as it is
  defined.
- **Sizes spelled as `sizeof`.** `MotionParam::storage`, where a character
  builds each motion set beyond its first, is `sizeof(tagMOTION_TYPE)` bytes
  rather than 128, and `CCharacter::Initialize` clears it by its `sizeof`.
  Both are 0x80 on the PS2; on the host a `tagMOTION_TYPE` is 0xB0, and with
  128 bytes a set's `frame_info` and `motion_info` lay in the next set's
  storage.
- **`#ifndef PORT` around assembly functions**, the one exception: clang
  cannot parse them. It replaces blank lines, so no line number moves. The
  generic `CDataAlloc<Kind, Size>::Align64()` in `ps2/include/dataalloc.hpp`
  is guarded too; nothing instantiates it, since both arenas specialise it.

Retail's own mistakes stay in `ps2/src`, because the match reproduces them:
locals read before anything sets them (`SaveToMc`'s `status`, `main`'s
`idle_result` and six more), non-void functions that fall off the end,
format strings that do not fit their arguments. Initialising any of the
locals changes what MWCC emits. The port gives them defined behaviour
instead:

- `-ftrivial-auto-var-init=zero`: locals start at zero.
- `-fno-strict-return`: falling off the end returns an unspecified value
  instead of being undefined.
- `-fno-strict-aliasing` and `-fwrapv`: the type punning and wraparound the
  code assumes.

`ps2/src` is compiled with `-Wall`. The warnings left on are the porting
work: uninitialised reads, missing returns, format strings, copies over
objects with a vtable and the like. Those that only describe how MWCC-era
code is spelled -- string literals as `char *`, MWCC's pragmas, 32-bit pointer
casts, the unused names and expressions matching leaves behind -- are off.

Clang also needs a few flags to accept code MWCC accepts:

- `-fms-extensions`: pointers truncated to `int`.
- `-Wno-c++11-narrowing`: narrowing in braced initialisers.
- `-Wno-register`: the `register` keyword.
- `-Wno-return-mismatch`: a bare `return;` in a non-void function.

The casts themselves compile; where one's value comes back as a pointer,
the function is the port's ("Pointers and 32-bit integers").

## Checking the PS2 build

An edit to `ps2/src` or `ps2/include` made for the port is checked by building
both regions (`scripts/build/cmake.sh build`, and again with `REGION=PAL`),
which verifies every image byte for byte.

## Game data

The game reads its files from a plain directory, not from the disc.
`port/build/pc/dcdata` (`tools/dcdata`) makes it:

```sh
port/build/pc/dcdata extract "rom/Dark Cloud (PAL).iso" data
port/build/pc/dcdata list "rom/Dark Cloud (PAL).iso"
```

The source is a disc image, read through its ISO 9660 tree, or a directory
that holds `DATA.DAT` and `DATA.HD2` (such as `rom/pal/extracted/iso`).
`extract` writes every file `DATA.HD2` indexes to `<data>/<path>`, the path
lowercased with `/` separators and no leading separator, at its exact size,
and copies the index itself to `<data>/data.hd2`. A file already present at
its size is kept, so a rerun only repairs what is missing. When a path is
listed twice, only the first is written, as the game only ever finds the
first. `list` prints each file's sector, size and path.

The layout of `data/` is the archive's own: `dun/pack/maindat.pac`,
`commenu/a_eng/savetex.pak`, `sound/bgm/...` and so on. Lookups fold case,
as the game's `strcasecmp` does, so the case on disk does not matter.

`port/src/platform/paths.cpp` finds the data directory from `--data <dir>`,
then `DC_DATA`, then `data/` in the working directory, then `data/` beside
the executable, and failing all of those `$XDG_DATA_HOME/chronicle/data`
(`~/.local/share/chronicle/data` when `XDG_DATA_HOME` is unset or relative),
where an installed copy keeps it. The save directory comes from `--save`,
`DC_SAVE`, or `save/` in the same two places; without one, saves go beside a
local `data/` if there is one, so a checkout or an unpacked copy stays
self-contained, and otherwise to `$XDG_DATA_HOME/chronicle/save`. It is
created when first used.

When the data directory is missing or holds no file and the run is not
headless, `FirstRunIfNoData` (`port/src/platform/firstrun.cpp`) opens the
window and asks for the disc: a disc image through SDL's file dialog (the
file-chooser portal under Flatpak, zenity elsewhere), or a folder holding
`DATA.DAT` and `DATA.HD2`. It extracts with `dcdata`'s core on a worker
thread into `<data>.partial`, drawing the file and byte counts through
`gfx::Draw2D` while the main thread pumps events, checks every file and
renames the directory into place, then closes its window and `main` goes
on. Escape or closing the window stops it (a later start resumes from the
partial directory); a failed extraction shows the extractor's message in a
message box and exits with status 1. `FirstRunSetChooser` replaces the
dialog, which is how the tests drive the flow headless. Declined, or
headless, `main` stops with status 3 and one line naming the directory and
the `dcdata` command, before anything else starts; `InitCDFile` would abort
on the same conditions. `InitCDFile` warns
when `data.hd2` lists a file that is missing or the wrong size. Files the
game looks for and does not find behave as on the disc: `LoadFile2` returns
0 and `LoadFile` asserts, naming the file (status 4).

## Packaging

`cmake --install port/build/pc --prefix <dir>` installs `darkcloud` and `dcdata`
to `<dir>/bin`; an installed copy finds its data and saves under
`$XDG_DATA_HOME/chronicle` (above). The Linux release is a Flatpak,
`org.themoonpeople.Chronicle`, built from `port/flatpak/` by
`.github/workflows/pc.yml`; `docs/FLATPAK.md` covers building,
installing, the first start and where the data and saves live.
